    "body": "__First, to address the easter egg and website stuff, here is my explanation/apology post > https://alex313031.blogspot.com/2024/01/the-good-bad-and-ugly.html__ (it also addresses why I was gone for a month).\r\n---------------------------------\r\n__M119__ <small>(M118 was too old, so skipped that version)</small>\r\n - Fixes multiple CVEs including https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xm5p-7w7v-qqr5\r\n - Better [HLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) support\r\n - Better JavaScript compilation performance due to new Thorium compiler flags as well as upstream V8 re-workings.\r\n - Updated Widevine versions\r\n - The search engine choices that Thorium adds are now available in more locales. (Notably not in Russia or China because ya know, their governments not allowing certain URLs. Hong Kong and Ukraine are not affected).\r\n - Live Caption should now finally work (English only, sorry. The .grdp files for other languages are closed source for now).\r\n - ChromeCast can now use VP8 and VP9 codecs for less bandwidth consumption if you have slower internet. (Note that this is disabled by default in Chromium, I enabled it, but it is still experimental).\r\n - New chrome://flags flag `chrome://flags#disable-aero` This disables transparency effects and GPU accelerated window frame compositing (while still leaving GPU acceleration for the actual web contents intact). It is useful if you dislike transparency, or are getting glitches on Windows 11 with the window frame.\r\n - Storage Access API was *disabled* because the security risk is more than the usability improvement. If you need this, use the new `chrome://flags/#storage-access-api` flag I added to enable it.\r\n - Keyboard shortcuts in [ThoriumOS](https://github.com/Alex313031/ThoriumOS) now align better with Linux.\r\n - Portable version now also sets the cache dir to [./.config/cache](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/commit/84b90666dae63da222cfbe1b27324d1b4a5c048f), to prevent any disk writes outside of the dir.\r\n - Rejoice! If you are like me and hate the new \"Download bubble\" and want the old \"Download shelf\" back, well I reverted a commit from upstream, and now there is a flag for it! > `chrome://flags#download-bubble`\r\n - Windows builds are now more hardened against memory overflows by enabling the arg \"win_enable_cfg_guards = true\"\r\n - PGO is now more effective (thanks @RobRich999) > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/commit/5fe393754c8f49a27940b332affd5cc028be1e1d\r\n - New flag from Ungoogled-Chromium `chrome://flags#tab-hover-cards` Allows removing tab hover card images, and instead replace with a tooltip (the behavior before M106).",

    "body": " - Removed Linux middle click autoscroll by default because it caused bugs for some people. You can still enable it by using the cmdline flag `--enable-blink-features=MiddleClickAutoscroll` (and I removed the warning bar for people who do). Fixes > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/199\r\n - You can now choose to not show full URLs. Previously it was forced to true, and selecting/unselecting \"Always show full URLs\" would do nothing. It is now still enabled by default, but you can choose to unselect it. I will be making a PR to Ungoogled Chromium about this.\r\n - HEVC/H.265 decoding is now multi-threaded. Thanks to @RobRich999 for pointing this out and where to enable it.\r\n - Two major security vulnerabilities in libwebp and libvpx were fixed. See the new [security policy](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/security/policy) for info about submitting security bugs, and a list of fixed vulnerabilities (which will be updated henceforth). If you use any of my Electron apps, those were also recently fixed.\r\n - On top of my [Thorium-Win7](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium-win7) fork, which will soon be updated to be based on [Supermium](https://github.com/win32ss/supermium) M118 (me and @gz83 are working on a unified patch for this), I also made a new repo: https://github.com/Alex313031/chromium-xp with ongoing work to resurrect Chromium on XP. I currently have fixed google search, compiling with the windows 10 sdk, and added Thorium's optimizations (minus AVX).\r\n - chrome_management_service should work properly now, if any of you out there are using Thorium with enterprise policies set.\r\n - Slightly higher Speedometer scores, due to both upstream optimizations, and me tweaking rustflags in the compiler config.",

    "body": "__M116__\r\n - `chrome://whats-new` page has been re-enabled by me, after Google made it \"Chrome only\". You will see it launch in a new tab on every version upgrade.\r\n - I enabled an experimental setting in Appearance to toggle tab hover cards. This can also be controlled via the traditional chrome://flags flag\r\n - I enabled an upcoming UI design change that was supposed to land in M117, but I enabled it early. This moves the Extensions submenu from \"More Tools\" in the main menu, into its own dedicated menu item.\r\n - New \"Name Window\" item in \"More Tools\". This allows you to manually override the window name, i.e. what appears in the window's title and what appears in the taskbar.\r\n - `initial_preferences` file is now included in the Windows installer, to show the [Welcome page](https://thorium.rocks/welcome/) on first launch after the first install.\r\n - New internal variable specifying the type (i.e. AVX, AVX2, SSE3, etc.) is being shipped to facilitate the new [Thorium-Win-Updater](https://github.com/ltguillaume/thorium-winupdater) project me and [ltguillaume](https://github.com/ltguillaume) have been working on, to allow auto update for Windows (Linux users already have it, if you are using [the deb repo](https://thorium.rocks/#installation)).\r\n\r\nThanks @gz83 @ltguillaume for helping.\r\n\r\nAlso, on another note, people have been complaining about me not releasing a new version on the *exact* same day as a new major Chromium version. To those people, I say, every major version takes me about 6+ Hours of intensive work to rebase. This is followed by many more hours for both me and @gz83 and @midzer to build each version, and this is assuming we are using all of our CPU cores pegged at 100% usage, which also slows our machines to a crawl for if we want to do anything else. Please be patient. If people still make issues or discussions about this, my response will be going forward: *Then you try maintaining a Chromium fork!*",

I actually have a web app on the Thorium website that can make use of this new web standard > https://thorium.rocks/misc/vector-icon-app/\r\n - Added Middle Click AutoScroll for Linux (normally only enabled on Windows). *Please report any bugs encountered* - Fixes https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/199\r\n - *REMOVED* Wayland VAAPI patch as it was causing too many bugs for too many people to be worth it. - Fixes https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/162\r\n - Tabstrip window dragging bug fix for Windows (and possibly Linux and Mac, pending further investigation). - Fixes https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/197\r\n - Profile picker crash fix. This was a major bug that occurred on all platforms, causing the browser to crash when trying to select a different profile other than the default one or guest one. Fixes https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-Win/issues/58 and https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-AVX2/issues/95. The cause of it was narrowed down to [this line](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/src/media/base/media_switches.cc#L999), something completely unrelated code wise, but somehow caused a segmentation fault in the memory manager.\r\n - NTP Discovery fix for Android (Not so much a \"fix\" but just removing it so it doesn't look ugly). - Fixes https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-Special/issues/16#issuecomment-1228140677\r\n - Fixed potential building problems on MacOS.\r\n\r\nMight also fix other strange tabstrip bugs that people experienced in M114.\r\n\r\nNext release we are planning to update libjxl and add a \"Close tabs to the left\" menu item.",

    "body": "## M114\r\n\r\n### Upstream Changes\r\n - Chromium 114 has even better support for WebGPU than 113. For more info about this, see the previous release notes.\r\n - Chromium and Thorium now support specifying and appending commandline flags via the `CHROME_EXTRA_FLAGS` environment variable. For example:\r\n`export CHROME_EXTRA_FLAGS=\"--no-sandbox\"` and then running `thorium-browser` from the same shell, will append --no-sandbox. You could set this in your *~/.bashrc* or */etc/profile* However, keep in mind that Thorium already also has a custom way to set default flags, by making/editing `~/.config/thorium-flags.conf`\r\n - V8 (Chromium's JavaScript engine) has added some new optimizations to the Maglev compiler. A noticeable difference in JIT javascript compilation can be seen between Chromium 113 and 114. Interesting read here > https://blog.chromium.org/2023/06/how-chrome-achieved-high-scores-on.html Thanks @midzer for telling me about this.\r\n\r\n### Thorium Changes\r\n - libjxl updated to [0.8.2](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium-libjxl/blob/main/VERSION.md) (Adds better transparency/alpha support) Thanks @gz83 for helping me with this.\r\n - libhighway updated to 1.0.4 (Minor [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) upgrade)\r\n - Fixes for Wayland (should hopefully fix https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/162)\r\n - HEVC and AC3 support have been restored (as promised)\r\n - More Android ARM64 optimizations\r\n - New \"[media foundation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/medfound/microsoft-media-foundation-sdk)\" widevine path on Windows by using the `enable_media_foundation_widevine_cdm = true` args.gn flag (should hopefully fix https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-Win/issues/48 and https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-AVX2/issues/84)\r\n - RPM support so that people on those distros don't have to use the .zip or .appimage anymore. (Fixes https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/139)\r\n - [Debian 12](https://www.debian.org/News/2023/20230610) \"Bookworm\" Support",

    "body": "## M113\r\n\r\n### Upstream Changes\r\n113 brings better support for [WebGPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGPU), and enables it by default. You can test it on my site here > https://thorium.rocks/misc/webgpu-test/ There are still some bugs with Nvidia GPUs on Linux. M114 seems to fix this. If you want to force WebGPU on, you can enable the `chrome://flags/#enable-unsafe-webgpu` flag. (I disabled the warning infobar with this flag since I use it alot, but know that by enabling it, malicious processes could potentially extract frames from GPU memory)\r\nIt also brings the new Performance pane in settings, to enable memory saver > `chrome://settings/performance` This allows Thorium to sleep tabs in the background. Edge users will be familiar with this feature.\r\n\r\n### Thorium Changes\r\nI had to remove HEVC/H.265 and AC3 support temporarily. M114 will have it back again, so stay on M112 if you need this. This is because [the guy](https://github.com/StaZhu/enable-chromium-hevc-hardware-decoding) who makes [the patch](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/other/add-hevc-ffmpeg-decoder-parser.patch) skipped M113, and HEVC support is a prerequisite for my custom AC3 patch. I could manually patch ffmpeg by looking at how the M112 patch was formatted. But thats *alot* of files, more than Thorium as a whole even uses. Sooooooo....Sorry....LoL. Like I said, use 112 or wait until 114 if you wanna watch H.265 videos or AC3 audio.\r\n\r\n**4 new flags:**\r\nTwo features I had previously enabled by default were removed upstream. I [re-added them](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/commit/17a3074d3f2cd32a05b71cdcb57942d5319845f0), but this time I put them behind two new flags > `chrome://flags/#tab-outlines-in-low-contrast-themes` and `chrome://flags/#prominent-dark-mode-active-tab-title`. They are disabled by default, and so in dark mode/incognito mode you will see a reversion back to the stock Chromium tabstrip theme. If you want the old behavior and look that Thorium has had since M100, simply enable these flags. Putting them behind flags was partially in response to [this issue](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/issues/156).\r\n\r\nThen, the other two are flags from UnGoogled, one of which I modified.\r\n - `chrome://flags/#scroll-tabs` The default behavior on Linux is to have this on. On other platforms you had to use a cmdline flag. Now, you can control it through the UI for ALL platforms (even Android). This is different from the scrollable tabstrip flag here > chrome://flags/#scrollable-tabstrip which moves the entire tabstrip. The one I added simply changes which tab is active (which I think is more useful).\r\n - `chrome://flags/#keep-all-history` This is the one I modified. Chromium by default only keeps history for 90 days. I raised this to 120 days. By enabling this flag, it will keep history forever. Note that this could cause your user profile dir to grow up to its maximum allowed of 2GB, if you were to enable this flag and then browse for ~many months, etc.\r\n------------\r\nAlso I am proud to finally announce a new ThoriumOS release. Updated many packages, it uses Thorium 113, and it has Google Drive support and NVidia GPU support!! Get it here > https://github.com/Alex313031/ThoriumOS/releases/tag/V113.0.5672.177",

This was actually used to test the replacement of the inline .png \"radioactive\" icon on `chrome://flags` with a .svg that is now embedded into the resources.pak file. I always liked this icon and hated when they removed it in Chromium M91. So I re-added it in Thorium M102 but you should really not use an inline .png file, it slows the rendering of pages. Since it now uses an external, very small (512 bytes!) .svg file, the flags page should load a little faster.\r\n![hazard](https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-AVX2/assets/45863095/f7ba2d34-6918-4e9b-91d4-fddc81b3e237) Here's the svg file if anyone wants it for something.\r\n\r\n &ndash; Added some new keyboard shortcuts:\r\n - `\"Ctrl+Shift+Q\"` to close all windows (exit)\r\n - `\"Ctrl+Shift+K\"` to open a new tab to the right\r\n - `\"Ctrl+Shift+D\"` to duplicate the current tab\r\n - `\"Ctrl+Shift+P\"` to pop out the current tab into a new window\r\n\r\n__Sorry for not getting these out in a timely manner! They were built many days ago but I just didn't upload them__ Thank @gz83 for building these.",

    "body": "__M110 is shaping up to be a great release!__ - Bugs with certain sites like youtube, and sites that use WebRTC or Chinese languages should be fixed.\r\n\r\n - __JPEG-XL functionality RESTORED__; thanks to @jonsneyers @mo271 and @gz83 for helping with this.  \\\r\n    There is a new repo for the source code for this, used as a submodule in this repo. > https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium-libjxl\r\n    In case you didn't know, Google decided to be a d**k and remove JPEG-XL support after M109, as well as Windows 7/8/8.1 support.\r\n - Thorium now supports the [AC3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Digital) codec, including in HEVC/H.265 videos. Thanks to @midzer for helping find a patch, which I manually converted to work on M110.\r\n - HEVC/H.265 videos now support *all* profiles.\r\n - More optimization flags for [V8](https://v8.dev/), Chromium's Javascript engine.\r\n - Added four new chrome://flags flags:\r\n   &ndash; __chrome://flags/#force-gpu-mem-available-mb__ - Set available VRAM to be used by Thorium. Options are 128, 256, 512, and 1024 Mb. Useful for systems with very low or very high video memory. The default (if unset) is 512 Mb. \\\r\n   &ndash; __chrome://flags/#enable-native-gpu-memory-buffers__ - Enable native CPU-mappable GPU memory buffer support on Linux. (Linux only) You can see the effect of this on chrome://gpu in the \"GpuMemoryBuffers Status\" section. \\\r\n   &ndash; __chrome://flags/#double-click-close-tab__ - A flag that @gz83 came up with and we both implemented. Allows you to close a tab by simply double-clicking on it, similar to an option in Vivaldi. \\\r\n   &ndash; __chrome://flags/#show-fps-counter__ - Show a F.P.S. counter on each display, which also shows used/available GPU memory. Useful for Web development.\r\n - Logo has had padding removed, and a new logo was created for the windows installer .exe.\r\n - New desktop action on Linux, to \"Open New Window with a temporary profile\". This can be used even if Thorium is already running. It will make a new profile in /tmp, and use that. NOTE: Upon system restart, the /tmp dir is cleared.\r\n - Thorium mascot image added to chrome://version page, under the copyright (for fun)\r\n\r\n## IMPORTANT for Windows Users\r\n   &ndash; Two new flags from ungoogled chromium, to enable truly portable usage were added. They unencrypt your user data dir, and remove tying it to a specific machine. Meaning you can drag the .zip around with you from machine to machine, and you wont lose passwords, extensions, etc. You will need to back up your current config, or start with a fresh one. I.E. you can go from Unencrypted > Encrypted, but not Encrypted (the default) > Unencrypted. I should have introduced these a long time ago. Sorry if this annoys users of the portable .zips. Note that enabling these flags is inherently less secure. \r\nThey are:\r\n__chrome://flags/#disable-encryption__ and\r\n__chrome://flags/#disable-machine-id__\r\n",

(Not only for these platforms, but see below.)\r\n - M109 Maintenance release.\r\n - HEVC patch updated.\r\n - Icon updated for Linux and Windows, which removes the padding on the outside of the thorium logo to match\r\nupstream change, the only effect is that the logo is slightly bigger.\r\n - More LLVM optimization flags\r\n - Removed the \"unsupported OS\" infobar banner for Win7/8/8.1 and Ubuntu 16.04, Debian 9, and Arch <2018.12\r\n\r\n*NOTE*: Going forward, Thorium will be built to more stable versions. This one is based on M109 stable (see below), future versions will be based on the equivalent of \"beta\" or \"dev\" channel, rather than tip-o-tree, i.e. \"canary\" channel.\r\n\r\n__IMPORTANT__ M109 is the *last version of Chromium for Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1* :cry: as per [Here](https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/185534985/sunsetting-support-for-windows-7-8-8-1-and-windows-server-2012-and-2012-r2-in-early-2023). I still use and enjoy Windows 7, and so have made a site for it here > https://thorium.rocks/win7 This is why this release is based on stable M109. I will be updating the links on my win7 page to link to these. Another deviation from standard Thorium releases, is that the windows 7 release will have a special 32 bit SSE2 build for old computers, on top of the SSE3, AVX, and AVX2 builds. There is also a small easter egg on the chrome://version page, to show love for one of Micro$oft's greatest OSes, back when that $ sign was a little smaller, lol.\r\n\r\nM109 will also be getting maintenance releases for the Win7/8/8.1 version, tracking the official chrome stable versions as per https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/releases?platform=Windows and I will be attempting to backport patches from M110 into M109, as time and knowledge permits.\r\n\r\n@gz83 @midzer",

I will be working on adding a flag that will remove the top bar icon's colour, since some people seem to dislike it.\r\n - Bookmarks bar now shows \"Apps\" like it used to, you can still disable it.\r\n\r\n__Built with new optimization: [Polly](https://polly.llvm.org/)__\r\nYou can see a write up of the optimizations Thorium uses (including the new Polly) [Here](https://thorium.rocks/optimizations), and a page with speed comparisons with screenshots [Here](https://thorium.rocks/performance). I compare Thorium against Chromium, Chrome, Brave, and Vivaldi.\r\n\r\nAlso, try my new extensions: [Thorium Scroll Tweaker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/thorium-scroll-tweaker/dgnjhkngmbcdbdmpbeechgihgijlajkf?hl=en&authuser=0)  (for increasing scroll speed on linux), and [Resources Saver](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/resources-saver/nlfcijlhljpenllloeheihmhoobeefpc?hl=en&authuser=0) (allows you to save a full website, keeping directory structure and downloading resources that would otherwise be missed by just right clicking and using \"Save As\".",

    "body": "__IMPORTANT__ The main executable is now named thorium.exe instead of chrome.exe, and the main thorium shell executable is now named thorium_shell.exe instead of content_shell.exe. The Readmes and portable scripts and building instructions have been updated. You MUST uninstall Thorium before installing this new release, I.E. do NOT just install the new .exe in place over the old one. You can uninstall it in control panel, and choose whether or not to keep your user profile data.\r\n\r\n__ALSO__ We are making a new website for Thorium! Check it out at > https://thorium.rocks/\r\n\r\n__Thorium UI Debug Shell__ A program for tinkerers, lets you explore inside the Thorium UI. Try it by running the views_examples_with_content.exe in the .zip.\r\n\r\n - M104 Refresh\r\n - Executable names changed to reflect Thorium name\r\n - Compatibility mode bug is FIXED.\r\n - New Security Patch : RSA uses 2048 bit length instead of 1024 \r\n - Show all extensions by default patch\r\n - Better tab outline when running with dark theme/in dark mode\r\n - Parallel Downloading enabled by default\r\n - Tab Hover Cards enabled by default\r\n - Drag and Drop tabs between windows on Wayland patch (Linux only)\r\n - Updated logo on chrome://components page\r\n - Chrome Labs shown by default with a new logo I made.\r\n - Support for FLAC audio\r\n - New setup .exe icon. The Chromium one is the same one since 2008, a 256 color 24px Windows XP installer icon. The new one is a 64px 32 bit icon that combines the Thorium logo with the Win 7+ installer icon.\r\n - CONTENT_SHELL.BAT has been renamed to THORIUM_SHELL.BAT\r\n\r\nAlso, try my scrollbar theme for Thorium > https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-ScrollBars It's great in dark mode!",

    "body": "- __My Haswell board went the way of the DoDo bird and died, so I wasn't able to continue AVX2 releases, but luckily, we have @gz83 to the rescue. He is the newest builder/contributer to Thorium and I welcome him to the two (now three) person team.__\r\n\r\n- Compatibility mode bug is STILL present on win10/win11 systems. If you are just upgrading, not doing a fresh install, you shouldn't have to do anything.\r\n\r\n- Also, try out my simple scrollbar theme for Thorium, Thorium Scrollbars. https://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium_ScrollBars If you are not familiar with how to manually install a chrome extension see https://stackoverflow.com/a/11879334/19023992\r\n\r\nThe thorium_compat_mode.bat is a little batch file I made to automate the setting of compatibility mode on windows 10/11 to mitigate the bug where it will say \"Error code: RESULT_CODE_MISSING_DATA\". You will have to right click and select \"run as administrator\" because it sets compatibility mode for all users, which means it writes to the HKLM registry hive which is restricted to admins.\r\n\r\n__- IMPORTANT: The User profile dir is now changed and set from\r\nC:\\Users\\$USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Chromium\\User Data >> C:\\Users\\$USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Thorium\\User Data\r\nTo migrate, make sure the Thorium user data dir is empty, and then just copy the entire contents of the Chromium one into it.\r\nI.E. If you havent run Thorium yet, just copy the whole User Data folder. If you've run it and then freak out because all your user profile data is gone, then delete the contents of the Thorium folder and copy the contents of the Chromium one into the Thorium one.__\r\n\r\nThis was done to be in line with the Thorium branding, as well as to allow side by side installations of Chromium and Thorium (including differing versions). This was already done on the Linux version for some time now, but I just now figured out where in source code you can change the install location/user data location on windows. Sorry if this disturbs your workflow.\r\nMac releases will also have this change soon.\r\n",

It only appears on Windows 10/11. Windows 7/8/8.1 are fine.\r\nRight click the Thorium shortcut, or the actual executable at C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Chromium\\chrome.exe , go to properties, and set the compatibility mode to windows 7 or 8.\r\nIssue was already known by me, but has been reported in these issues, and thought I'd post a notice on this release.\r\nhttps://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-AVX2/issues/2\r\nhttps://github.com/Alex313031/Thorium-AVX2/issues/1",
