# Simple Chromium Updater (chrupd.cmd)

" _Self executable PowerShell script to auto update Chromium for Windows_ "

‚úÖ Runs on all Windows versions

‚úÖ One file download, no need to install and no other software required

‚úÖ Needs little to no configuration, but (advanced) options are available

This script uses the RSS feed from <https://chromium.woolyss.com> or GitHub API to download and install the latest Chromium version, if a newer version is available.

Download and run `chrupd.cmd` or read below for more details.

When you run the script it does the following:

- by default it'll get the Chromium "stable" 64-bit Installer by "Hibbiki"
- verifies SHA1/MD5 file hash and runs installer
- chrupd auto updates itself

Options can be set in script or by using command line arguments.

\* _Name used be called "Editor" in previous versions_

\* _Defaults in **bold**_

Make sure the combination of name and channel you pick is correct. You can also use `chrupd.cmd -list`. For more information about versions check [chromium.woolyss.com](https://chromium.woolyss.com/?cut=1&ago=1), it's [feed](https://chromium.woolyss.com/feed/windows-64-bit) and [chromium.org](https://www.chromium.org).

- using `-name Ungoogled` still works (now done by Marmaduke)
- for the builds from chromium.org use `Official`
- some authors release archive files instead of installers, more info: [docs/Files.md](/docs/Files.md#archives)

## ‚è∞ Scheduled Task

To make sure Chromium is always automatically updated to the latest version you can optionally add a Scheduled Task by using `chrupd.cmd -crTask`. A VBS wrapper will be written to **chrupd.vbs** which is used to hide it's window. Option `noVbs` disables the wrapper, this will however cause a flashing window when the task runs. Specifed settings for 'name' and 'channel' are used to run the script every day.

## üîÉ Updating Script

The script auto updates itself (since v20210109).

(**!**) If you keep getting an error about "Unable to get new script, skipped update", this means a new version was detected but the script was unable to get the new version from GitHub. Try again later or manually update.

To manually update to a newer script version just replace "chrupd.cmd". Copy "name" and "channel" if set. If you have Scheduled Task setup you do not need to change the task.

## üìÅ Files

For easy execution this PowerShell script is embedded in a Batch .CMD file 'chrupd.cmd' which is all you need to run.

See [docs/Files.md](/docs/Files.md) for details about other repository files.
