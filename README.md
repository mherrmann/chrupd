# Simple Chromium Updater (chrupd.cmd)

*_Self executable PowerShell script to auto update Chromium for Windows_*

---

**Latest version: 20211002 ([CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md))**

---

This script uses the feed from <https://chromium.woolyss.com> to download and install the latest Chromium version, if a newer version is available.

When you run the script it does the following:

- by default it'll get the Chromium "stable" 64-bit Installer by "Hibbiki"
- verifies SHA1/MD5 hash and runs installer
- chrupd auto updates itself

Options can be set in script or by using command line arguments.

Download and run `chrupd.cmd` or read below for more details.

## Configuration

Make sure the combination of editor and channel is correct. You can also use `chrupd.cmd -list`. For more information about versions check [chromium.woolyss.com](https://chromium.woolyss.com/?cut=1&ago=1), it's [feed](https://chromium.woolyss.com/feed/windows-64-bit) and [chromium.org](https://www.chromium.org).

| Editor                            | Channel         |
|:----------------------------------|:----------------|
| Marmaduke                         | stable, dev     |
| Marmaduke - `Ungoogled`           | stable          |
| The Chromium Authors - `Official` | dev             |
| ThumbApps                         | dev             |
| **Hibbiki**                       | **stable**, dev |

( _defaults in **bold**_  )

- using `-editor Ungoogled` still works (now done by Marmaduke)
- for the builds from chromium.org use `Official`
- some editors release archive files instead of installers, more info: [docs/Archives.md](/docs/Archives.md)

## Scheduled Task

To make sure Chromium is automatically updated to the latest version you can optionally add a Scheduled Task by using `chrupd.cmd -crTask`. A VBS wrapper will be written to **chrupd.vbs** which is used to hide it's window. Option `noVbs` disables the wrapper, this will however cause a flashing window when the task runs. Specifed settings for 'editor', 'channel' and 'channel' are used to run the script every day.

## Updating Script

The script auto updates itself (since v20210109).

To manually update to a newer script version just replace "chrupd.cmd". Copy "editor" and "channel" if set. If you have Scheduled Task setup you do not need to change the task.

## File Formats

For easy execution this PowerShell script is embedded in a Batch .CMD file, which can be renamed to .PS1.

See [docs/Formats.md](/docs/Formats.md) for details.

## Command Line Options

`chrupd.cmd -h`
